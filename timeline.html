                            AI can be deadly. <br>

                            First, there are two ‘existential’ threats. <br><br>

                            (a) AI can automate a lot of mundane jobs. This can put a lot of people out of work. While human society is exceptionally good at coming up with new jobs and things to do, it is far from clear that job creation process will out-speed job destruction process.

                            Job destruction per se is not necessarily bad - the original purpose of all so-cherished technological progress has been to relieve humans of hard work - think of the wheel invention. However, job destruction can have bad consequences within this particular socio-politico-economic setup we are living in, where if you are out of job, and society has no need for you, you are going down.

                            In particular, it is not impossible that we may end up in a situation where labor of a portion of population assisted by AI will be enough to provide all goods and services required by the whole population. Under current political regimes this could be catastrophic and lead to tensions between the few owners of the means of production and the non-owners.

                            It is in response to these concerns that ideas such as basic income have been proposed and experimented with [Hawaii just became the first US state to pass a bill supporting basic income — here's the man behind it, Finland is testing universal basic income - and found it has had an unexpected side effect, Switzerland's voters reject basic income plan - BBC News].

                            The gravity of this concern and its growing popularity among younger people will also be a guiding force behind growing strength of socialist political forces in the Western societies.

                            <br><br>(b) AI can become sentient (conscious, possessing subjective perception and free will - or any other preferred definition), and then turn against people.

                            This may seem farfetched, as the current state of machine learning technology does not offer a clear path to building a sentient machine from the ground up.

                            With only a nascent international legal framework to control the use of such autonomous machines, we may soon end up in a world where machines programmed to kill with mathematical precision will outmatch both in deadliness and numbers ordinary human soldiers. What if such technology is developed to fruition by a country or group of people who do not have respect for human life and freedom? It remains to be seen.
                            <br><br>
                            (a) Finally, even if AI does not gain sentience, and is programmed only with good intentions in mind, there still remains a possibility of an error. Whether it is an error during the control of a nuclear power plant, or your new shiny Tesla car, or a missile launch, or a stock exchange, or an automated dispute resolution system, the errors can be far more grave in consequences than any naughtiness intentionally programmed in.

                            Whereas previous issues are more societal in scope, and are up for higher powers to adjudicate, this issue of errors is something AI developers bear the most immediate responsibility for, and have to take great care to plan for and prevent.

                            There may be other threats that AI poses to humans, but I feel the above four are the most critical ones and deserve careful thinking by politicians, business leaders, and engineers alike.

                            However, does all this risk mean we should restrict the development of AI? I would argue against it, as possible benefits (freedom from hard undesirable labor, discovery of new cures to diseases, safer driving, etc.) so far seem to outweigh the cost, even if the society may have to fundamentally change its structure and regulation to accommodate automation.

                            Cautious optimism in the face of uncertainty seems to be the right way to go.

                        <p>
                            Today I had a sudden and very drastic change in my position on this question. <br><br>

                            A while back I wrote an answer to a similar question: How is artificial intelligence the biggest threat to humanity? In that answer I roughly explained my long-held belief that methodologies of computation, and our computer architectures, are a collection of human constructs. Despite their many abilities that highly surpasses those of their makers (efficiency and accuracy of arithmetic, performance on finely scoped-tasks, etc.), computers do what they are programmed to do. I strongly believed that for now, and very likely not before long, computers would be incapable of the level of automated logical abstraction that's even close to that of humans. Therefore there's little evidence that AI could be dangerous apart from explicit efforts by its creators.

                            This all changed with one very recent event: Microsoft deletes 'teen girl' AI after it became a Hitler-loving sex robot within 24 hours

                            Microsoft Tay was an idea that lots of people thought about - a not so new concept of something akin to a chatter bot, combined with the power of data mining and NLP.

                            Our perceptions of AI are biased by Sci-Fi movies that show us AI Machines taking over the galaxy. Honestly speaking, there are different opinions among the AI researchers. Some of them are in favor of singularity and many of them slam it as bullshit.
                            <br><br>
                            Technological Singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial Superintelligence will be capable of self-improvement to build more powerful civilization of itself, that is more intelligent than the humans, which could take over the world.
                            <br><br>
                            For me, as the kid of Gen-Y, it is mind-blowing to think how the first movie ever was produced in the year my great grandfather was born, the first computer was built when my grandfather was still in his teens, the first Star Wars movie was released when my father learned fishing and how only last month, I blew my mind watching the first movie named Sunspring written by an AI program that christened itself as Benjamin.
                            <br><br>
                            Not going to be long before I know, my kid wakes me up in the middle of the night someday and tells me, ‘Hey dad! One super intelligent robot called Trump has waged a war against humanity to destroy the entire human race.’ And WHAM! The most dreaded Apocalypse is a reality. Who knows?
                            <br><br>
                            If you are still optimistic and think that it is just a trippy thought experiment, here’s the generalized version of Moore’s law, depicted by Kurzweil as The Law of Accelerating Returns.
                            <br><br>
                            Kurzweil provides an interesting way of looking at the advancement of Artificial in terms of CPS achieved per $1000. The exponential nature of this curve can be visualized with respect to human intelligence and how quickly we are advancing towards the human level intelligence.
                            <br><br>
                            Not a long ago, we were struggling to artificially replicate the brain, read intelligence, of an insect and just so overwhelmingly, we are not too far from artificially achieving the intelligence of the most superior specie on the planet earth. What lies beyond that is a mystery for a layman but we indeed are living in the golden era of the exponential curve of technological progress.
                            <br><br>
                            Is AI a threat to humanity right now? No.
                            Is AI a threat in the near future? Maybe Yes.
                            How near is the future? Theoretically, not so far.

                            We are dependent on technology. That's a fact. There are seven billion of us on the planet, and without technology, we’d max out at perhaps three. So unless you want to choose four billion people to kill, there's little point to complaining about it. Technology is what makes us successful as a species.
                            <br><br>
                            Few people complain about the technology that brings food to our tables or makes our waste magically go away so we don't have to live in caves carved from mountains of our own filth.
                            <br><br>
                            Usually, those who fret about “too much technology” are basically just saying “things aren't how they used to be and I don't like that,” which is what such people have been saying since bronze axes were the latest in bleeding-edge innovation.
                            <br><br>
                            We rely on technology. Your life depends just as much on technology to support it as if you lived in a nuclear-powered submarine. That's not a bad thing; that technology allows you a longer, better, healthier life. Why would that be a problem?

                        <p>
                            When humans first evolved, the most important way we survived was by using simple tools (flint knives, spears, etc) to allow us to hunt and gather more effectively.  Even then, to some small degree, people depended on technology to survive.  People lived in small, nomadic tribes which, by today's standards, didn't roam too far, because all travel had to be on foot.
                            <br>
                            When people switched from a nomadic to an agrarian society, several thousand years ago, we needed more technology to help plant and harvest more food.  Why?  Because an agrarian lifestyle allowed the population to increase and in particular the population density rose dramatically. More people require more food.
                            <br>
                            As time progressed and the population in cities grew, this brought on new problems, which were solved with more advanced technology.
                            <br>
                            Then, add in people's rising expectations.  Today's innovation becomes taken for granted.  We are communicating, today, across the world using a technology that didn't exist, say, 30 years ago.  And we take this for granted.
                            <br>
                            The more advanced technology becomes, the more interdependent people in the society are, because we are each responsible for a small piece.  Think of how many thousands of people have to do their jobs for our lives as we know them to exist.
                            <br>
                            That is why society becomes so dependent on technology.<br>
